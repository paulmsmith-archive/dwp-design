# DWP Design System

The DWP Design system is a collection of design patterns, components, and guidelines to ensure the creation of unified services for citizens and civil servants.

This repository contains the code and assets for a trial of [Fractal](http://fractal.build).

## To do:

- [X] Write gulp tasks (Fractal CLI, linting, building, compressing assets, ..etc)
- [X] Integrate existing gov.uk frontend resources
- [ ] Write documentation (Introduction/Overview, how-to, principles, code standards..) **[Started this]**
- [ ] Create GOV.UK Elements frontend components
- [ ] Investigate Design Tokens - Convert GOVUK colours to JSON/YAML
- [ ] Train the team on updated content and documentation

[See more in the project 'build'](https://github.com/paulmsmith/dwp-design/projects/2)

## Process

`hypothesis -> develop -> test -> refine -> "prove" -> publish`

Solution is used and is identified or proposed as a ‘Pattern’. 

Pattern is reviewed, tested and built in the best way possible:

1. Accessible
2. Performant
3. Maintainable.
4. Reusable.

## Purpose of the DWP Design System:

* Single place for DWP Teams to find ‘Production Ready’ HTML + CSS + Javascript for Citizen facing and internal services. **Make the right thing to do, the easy thing to do.** *No more bootstrap*

* Documentation for how teams should write, test and maintain HTML + CSS + Javascript for the DWP. Get teams doing things consistently to a high standard.

* A way for teams and developers to write their own patterns and code which can be shared back with the department (and wider gov). **Avoid teams solving the same problems.**

## Our users:

- Product Owners
- Content Designers
- Front-end developers
- Software Engineers ('Full stack developers', Backend developers)
- Interaction Designers

## What we’re not doing:

- Building components or code not identified in services as genuine UI or interaction patterns. 
- Creating something that competes with or counter acts [gov.uk frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_alpha) we want to work alongside and contribute to the efforts of The Government Digital Service.
