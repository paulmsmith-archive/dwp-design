<h2 id="understandable-outputs">Mission statement</h2>

<p>The objective of this design system is to be a 'single source of truth' for design patterns, components, and guidelines to ensure the creation of unified services for citizens and civil servants.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why does DWP need a design system?</h2>

<p>Departments such as DWP, HMRC and others aim to follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-principles">the design principles</a> as described by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service">Government Digital Service</a> (GDS). However each department has their own distinct challenges in how they organise themselves to deliver the best possible services to citizens.</p>

<p>The DWP Design System is formulated in a way that works best for the capability and restraints of DWP but is essentially an extention of the wider GDS design system for GOV.UK.</p>

<p class="text-align--center"><img src="/images/content/gds_orbit.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We are working collaboratively with GDS to ensure the same high standard of research, design and execution. We should be doing so in a way which means the wider government can benefit from our work as it is highly likely to be addessing cross-government problems.</p>

<p>The design system is a service in it's own right. We believe it is important that when providing design assets, we do so in a format that is trusted, current and easily understood by those using them.</p>
