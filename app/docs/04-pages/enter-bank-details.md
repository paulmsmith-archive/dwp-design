<p>User research for <a href="http://dwp-digital-services.herokuapp.com/projects/8/carers_allowance_digital_service">Carerâ€™s Allowance</a> found that a significant number of users didn't have bank accounts at the time they applied or were reluctant to give their bank details online before they were actually awarded the benefit.</p>

<h3 id="progress-choice-content-notes">Content notes</h3>

<p>On Carer's allowance this was originally titled 'Payment'. This implied to users that they were being asked to pay from their account, not have money paid into it.</p>

<p>Post Office Card account information was only included in Carer's allowance because the service has an unusually high number of users with this type of account. This type of account is actually opened for users by the service if they don't have a bank account by the time the first payment is due.</p>
