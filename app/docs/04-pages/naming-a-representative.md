<ul>
	<li>This is being used in the <a href="http://dwp-digital-services.herokuapp.com/projects/5/apply_for_an_access_to_work_grant">Access to Work service</a>.</li>
	<li>It was designed to overcome the difficulty faced by some people in giving appropriate contact details. For example, deaf applicants who use an interpreter found it unclear whether they should nominate them, and whether to give their own or their interpreter's contact details.</li>
	<li>This content was proven to let people name formal or informal (ie, legal) representatives and give the most appropriate contact details for their needs.</li>
	<li>Note, content should be specific to the service about the things that the representative will be asked about, you don't have to use the things listed in the example.</li>
</ul>
