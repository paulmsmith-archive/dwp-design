<h2 id="standard-pattern">Standard pattern</h2>

<p>Use this when:</p>

	<li>there are legal consequences to giving false information</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="declaration-and-consent">Consent and declaration</h2>

<p>Use this when:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the user needs to make another interaction (eg to give their consent for the DWP to contact people they’ve listed)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="declaration-and-consent-content-notes">Content notes</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Refer to the user in the second person apart from in the action text.</li>
	<li>Use bullets introduced by the text ‘By sending this [application] you agree:’ and list any conditions of applying.</li>
	<li>If reporting changes is required this should give an example of what and explain how.</li>
	<li>Use links for explanatory content - the declaration only has to give the user opportunity to read terms, not contain them itself.</li>
	<li>The number of conditions may vary - only list the conditions that apply to your service (5 standard messages are given in the examples).</li>
	<li>Any other content should be placed above the legal declaration.</li>
	<li>The risks and consequences should include the warning call out style (an exclamation mark).</li>
	<li>Avoid the word ‘prosecute’ unless you get specific legal advice otherwise.</li>
	<li>Don’t use a check box - the action button represents positive action and acceptance.</li>
	<li>The text of the action button should be in the first person ‘I agree’.</li>
</ul>
